Last year, I made the decision to pursue a career in software development, a rather significant shift for me. In college, I had studied music theory and composition. I was and remain passionate about music, but having worked in the world of classical music administration for nearly a decade, I felt it was time to explore other options. I enjoyed my work and met some wonderful people along the way, but I realized it was simply not where I wanted to be long-term. I was looking for a new direction that would be challenging and rewarding. And frankly, I wanted a career path with more opportunities on the horizon than the relatively insular world I had been inhabiting.

I learned from my wife that one of her co-workers (recent Flatiron graduate Adrian Brown!) had enrolled in a web development course, and that the school was starting an online version as well. Adrian had nothing but great things to say about the school, so I signed up for the free introductory course on Learn.co. Nothing to lose, I figured!

My family were early adopters of personal computing going back to the earliest Macintoshes of the 80’s, so I was always comfortable with computers. But for one reason or another, I never actually pursued software development. I suppose it seemed like an intimidating world to break into; the sheer volume of things to know can be overwhelming. But once I took the leap, I found myself having a blast learning the fundamentals of Ruby on Learn.co. The work was challenging, but presented in such a way that it always felt digestable, within my reach. Even if I had to bang my head against certain problem for a few hours, I never felt like I was stalling out for too long. And when I would finally get a tricky piece of code working . . . what a wonderfully gratifying feeling.

After finishing the introductory course, even realizing I had only just begun to scrape the surface of web development, I knew it was a good fit for me. Although I was a novice coder, I could see there was a lot about it that I liked; it felt like some kind of amalgam of learning a new language, solving a puzzle, doing some fine-toothed copy-editing, and even writing a piece of music! Fun!! I took the full plunge in January and enrolled in the full stack web development program. I think it may turn out to be one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I’m having a blast, learning every day, and looking forward to my new life as a developer!
